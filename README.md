 Place an order for a customer.
 An order status can be updated i.e., Preparing, out-for-delivery, delivered
 Saving all the record upon exit
 Retrieving the existing data upon reload
 Well tested, trustable and error free application

Specification of fulfilment of client’s requirement:

The application

 Reads and load all the existing data from csv files
 User can place new order, view, update and delete any existing order
 User can add products(menu), view, update or delete any existing products
 User can add courier Information, view, update and delete any courier info

ACTION PLAN FOR FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION:

 Using classes and Object-oriented programming to make the code simple, to organize the data members and methods in one place, making the program more organized.

 Code optimization and error handling in most parts of the code
 Need to fix menu# in sub menus
 Test Cases needs to be written for most of the functions

The Most Enjoyable part of implementation:
Read/write csv files
